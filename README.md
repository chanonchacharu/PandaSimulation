# Panda Simulation
### Project Description

The simulation runs on a timer that automatically switch the scenery from day to night. The graphics are drawn on the window panel. The users can interact with the panda via various options provided on the frame. For instance, player can feed the panda bamboo leaf, play skateboard with it, and many more. *ActionListener* is used to help achieved the desired interaction.
