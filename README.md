# Panda Simulation

This project is part of DES103 Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory Final assignment.

In this project, I created a Panda Simulation. The simulation runs on a timer that switch the scenery from day to night. The graphics are drawn on the window panel. The users can interact with the panda via various options provided on the frame. ActionListener is used to help achieved the desired interaction.
